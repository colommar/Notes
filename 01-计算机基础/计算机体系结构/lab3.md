# titie: pipeline technique in processor 
## target
a) Get more basic knowledge of x86 pipeline implementation, including fetch stage, decode stage, dispatch stage, issue stage, write back stage, and commit stage.

b) Observe the pipeline simulation results in the simulator Multi2sim so that students can understand the pipeline dependences and hazards (data, structural, and control) and solutions well.

c) Simulate different branch prediction methods such as static prediction and dynamic prediction so that students know much more about the speculate design in pipeline optimization.

#### General Simulation Statistics

- **RealTime**: 96.39 seconds
    - This is the total time that the simulation took to run from start to finish in real-world time.
- **SimEnd**: ContextsFinished
    - Indicates that the simulation ended because all the contexts (processes or tasks) have been completed.
- **SimTime**: 992045.00 nanoseconds (about 0.992 seconds)
    - The total simulated time, which is the time period the simulator models, not the actual clock time it took to run the simulation.
- **Frequency**: 1000 MHz (1 GHz)
    - The frequency at which the simulated processor is running.
- **Cycles**: 992046
    - The total number of cycles executed during the simulation, closely matching the simulated time in nanoseconds, suggesting that most operations took about one cycle.

#### x86 Specific Statistics

- **RealTime**: 96.38 seconds
    - Almost identical to the general real-time, indicating that the x86 component was the primary or only component running in this simulation.
- **Instructions**: 773343
    - Total number of instructions processed by the x86 simulator.
- **InstructionsPerSecond**: 8024
    - The rate at which instructions were processed per second, which is relatively low considering modern processor capabilities. This might indicate a simulation of a more complex or resource-intensive task or a simulated processor operating under constrained conditions.
- **SimTime**: Matches the general simulated time of 992046.00 nanoseconds.
- **Frequency**: Matches the general frequency of 1000 MHz.
- **Cycles**: 992046
    - Matches the general cycles count, confirming the close relationship between these metrics.
- **CyclesPerSecond**: 10293
    - Indicates how many cycles per second the simulation processed, which is higher than the instructions per second, suggesting that not every cycle results in an instruction being processed.

#### Analysis and Insights

- **Efficiency**: The data shows that the simulation is modeling an environment where not every cycle is utilized for instructions, which is common in real-world scenarios due to various delays and dependencies in processing.
- **Real-Time vs. Simulated Time**: There's a significant discrepancy between the real-time (over 96 seconds) and the simulated time (under one second). This discrepancy highlights the computational complexity and the resource demands of the simulated task, likely reflecting the intense calculations involved in sorting a vector of 500 elements in the simulated environment.
- **Instruction Handling**: The simulator managed a relatively modest number of instructions per second, suggesting that either the operations are particularly complex, or the simulated system's resources are highly constrained.
2. look the my-trace file but actually I cannot find out what is in the file. I can only find out the compile code in the file.

4. it shows the usage and really means of the compile code.

5.  i wrote my-sort and willingly it can be compiled. But unluckily it doesn't make worse. Then I find out the wrong part. I need to add the -m32 tag which means it was a 32 bit file.

6. see the detailed the of the x86 architecture.
![Pasted image](<resources/Pasted image 20240509144157.png>)
7. changing the detaile part and use the config.ini.
   The `config.ini` is provided by the teacher.

#### General Simulation Statistics

#### config.ini:

- **RealTime**: 5.70 seconds
- **SimTime**: 375164.00 nanoseconds (about 0.375 seconds)
- **Frequency**: 1000 MHz (1 GHz)
- **Cycles**: 375165

#### initial:

- **RealTime**: 7.50 seconds
- **SimTime**: 445297.00 nanoseconds (about 0.445 seconds)
- **Frequency**: 1000 MHz (1 GHz)
- **Cycles**: 445298

#### x86 Specific Statistics

#### config.ini:

- **RealTime**: 5.69 seconds
- **Instructions**: 92528
- **InstructionsPerSecond**: 16265
- **SimTime**: 375165.00 nanoseconds
- **Cycles**: 375165
- **CyclesPerSecond**: 65947
- **CommittedInstructions**: 92528
- **CommittedInstructionsPerCycle**: 0.2466
- **CommittedMicroInstructions**: 154557
- **CommittedMicroInstructionsPerCycle**: 0.412
- **BranchPredictionAccuracy**: 1 (100% accuracy)

#### initial:

- **RealTime**: 7.49 seconds
- **Instructions**: 196162
- **InstructionsPerSecond**: 26195
- **SimTime**: 445298.00 nanoseconds
- **Cycles**: 445298
- **CyclesPerSecond**: 59465
- **CommittedInstructions**: 92534
- **CommittedInstructionsPerCycle**: 0.2078
- **CommittedMicroInstructions**: 154563
- **CommittedMicroInstructionsPerCycle**: 0.3471
- **BranchPredictionAccuracy**: 0.8641 (86.41% accuracy)

#### Analysis of Differences:

1. **Simulation Duration and Time**:
    
    - The `initial` simulation shows a longer real time and simulated time compared to `config.ini`, suggesting a more complex or larger simulation task was performed.
2. **Instruction Handling**:
    
    - The `initial` simulation processed significantly more instructions (196162 vs 92528) at a higher rate (26195 vs 16265 instructions per second). This indicates a more intensive computation or possibly more efficient instruction handling despite the longer duration.
3. **Cycles and Efficiency**:
    
    - Both simulations maintained a 1 GHz frequency but the cycles per second were slightly lower in the `initial` simulation (59465 vs 65947), which correlates with the more intensive computation.
    - Committed instructions per cycle decreased in the `initial` simulation (0.2078 vs 0.2466), suggesting less efficient use of each cycle in handling instructions despite handling more instructions overall.
4. **Branch Prediction Accuracy**:
    
    - The `config.ini` simulation achieved perfect branch prediction accuracy (100%), whereas the `initial` simulation had lower accuracy (86.41%). This could imply more complex control flow scenarios in the `initial` simulation that challenged the branch predictor.

This revised comparison illustrates how changes in simulation parameters between `config.ini` and `initial` setups impact the overall performance and efficiency of the system being modeled.
8. visualize the my-trace but find some error.

9. Trying hard to solve the problem which can be seen in the `history`.
![Pasted image](<resources/Pasted image 20240509170312.png>)
10. Finally it succeed and this is the result.
    I guess the error is that I used `putty` to use the ssh.
    But the visualization should be opened in the `ubuntu gnome desktop`.
