### Experiment 5
This experiment follows the previous one and involves configuring and simulating a network.

#### Main Experiment Process

1. **Open Terminal and Navigate to Networks Directory**
   - Example: `samples/network/the example-4`

2. **Network Configuration in 'net.mesh' File**
   - This file is composed of four parts: networks, nodes, switches, and links.

   **Network Configuration**
   - Define the overall network structure.

   **Node Configuration**
   - Define the properties and roles of the nodes.

   **Switch Configuration**
   - Define the properties and roles of the switches.

   **Links Configuration**
   - Define the connections between nodes and switches.

3. **Run the Stand-Alone Interconnection Network Simulation**
   - Use the specified command to execute the simulation.

4. **Visualize Results**
   - Run `./graphplot` to see the visual results.
   - Example output: `net0_net,vis`

#### Example Output Visualization
- Shows the structure and connections of the network.
- The network designer can adjust topology and link bandwidths to balance traffic and optimize resources.

#### Additional Work

1. **Adjust Default Bandwidth and Packet Size**
   - Compare the differences in performance and output.

2. **Adjust Destination in Links**
   - Analyze the impact on network performance and visualize the results.
